        The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by 
        Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg. It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR.
         The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!".
         It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine.
         [5] The Agera RS variant became the world's fastest production car in 2017,
          setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) 
          and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph).[6]
          The Agera ceased production in July 2018 with the unveiling
           of the two final edition cars at the 2018 Goodwood Festival of Speed. 
           It was succeeded by the Jesko in 2019.[7][4]
